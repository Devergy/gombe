This is a slight modification of the tzmapping tool. We have added cell phone reception data and mining data, both of which we found useful for identifying target areas. We have also added a form to report any issues with the map data. The form is connected to a google sheet that we are sharing with open street maps, so that the data is updated. 

*I have also created integrations for the epicollect5 API and google sheets. I did not include them because there is no 'plug-and-play' solution. You will have to generate your own keys and input your own user data. I am happy to share and walk you through the integrations, just send me an email or message me on github.

Webmap (using leaflet) for visualizing village cluster identification and prioritization for off-grid electrification in Tanzania.

The overall objective of this project is to prioritize locations for off-grid rural electrification in Tanzania. New datasets will be developed that will enable faster and more accurate market analysis for distributed energy services companies (DESCOs) operating in Tanzania, including household locations and indicators on ability to pay, potential for productive uses of electricity and up-to-date data on national electricity grid transmission and distribution line locations. Collectively, it is expected that these datasets will help DESCOs operating in, or seeking to enter, Tanzania to narrow down geographic areas that could be interesting markets for their off-grid energy services.

This objective will be achieved by a combination of remote sensing, GIS analyses and other data collection. These activities are complemented by stakeholder workshops and local capacity development.
